**[Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)**

Medium

A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

- For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

- For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
- Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
- While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, _find the next permutation of_ `nums`.

The replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]

Output: [1,3,2]
```


**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]

Output: [1,2,3]
```


**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,5]

Output: [1,5,1]
```


**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

#### Approach 1: Brute Force Approach

#### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n! * n)
    
- Space complexity: O(n! * n)
    

**Steps:**

Step 1: Find all possible permutations of elements present and store them.

Step 2: Search input from all possible permutations.

Step 3: Print the next permutation present right after it.

#### Code

```cpp
// Brute Force Approach
// Time complexity -> O(n!*n) and Space -> O((n!) * n)
class Solution {
private:
    void recPermuteUnique(int index, vector<int> &nums, set<vector<int>> &set, vector<int> temp)
    {
        if(index==nums.size())
        {
            set.insert(temp);
            return;
        }
        for(int i=index;i<temp.size();i++)
        {
            swap(temp[index],temp[i]);
            recPermuteUnique(index+1,nums,set,temp);
        }
    } 
public:
    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<vector<int>> output;
        int index=-1;
        vector<int> temp=nums;
        sort(temp.begin(),temp.end());
        set<vector<int>>set;
        recPermuteUnique(0,nums,set,temp);
        for(auto it: set)
        {
           output.push_back(it);
        } 
        for(int i=0;i<output.size();i++)
        {
            if(output[i]==nums)
            {
                index=i;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(index==output.size()-1)
        {
            nums=output[0];
        }
        else
        {
            nums=output[index+1];
        }
    }
};
```

Above Code ❌ give **Time Limit Exceeded** due to high time complexity O((n!) * n)

#### Approach 2: Better Approach

#### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    

Using in-built function

C++ provides an in-built function called next_permutation() which directly returns the lexicographically next greater permutation of the input.

#### Code

```cpp
// Better Approach
// Time complexity -> O(n) and Space -> O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
        next_permutation(nums.begin(),nums.end());
    }
};

```



#### Approach 3: Optimized Approach

#### Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
    
- Space complexity: O(1)
    

The steps are the following:

1. **Find the break-point, i:** Break-point means the **_first index i from the back of the given array_** where arr[i] becomes smaller than arr[i+1].
    
    For example, if the given array is {2,1,5,4,3,0,0}, the break-point will be index 1(_0-based indexing_). Here from the back of the array, index 1 is the first index where arr[1] i.e. 1 is smaller than arr[i+1] i.e. 5.
    
    _To find the break-point, using a loop we will traverse the array backward and store the index i where arr[i] is less than the value at index (i+1) i.e. arr[i+1]._
    
2. **If such a break-point does not exist i.e. if the array is sorted in decreasing order,** the given permutation is the last one in the sorted order of all possible permutations. So, the next permutation must be the first i.e. the permutation in increasing order.  
    So, **_in this case, we will reverse the whole array and will return it as our answer._**
    
3. **If a break-point exists:**
    
    1. Find the smallest number i.e. > arr[i] and in the right half of index i(i.e. from index i+1 to n-1) and swap it with arr[i].
    2. Reverse the entire right half(i.e. from index i+1 to n-1) of index i. And finally, return the array.



##### Observation

**Observation 1:**
Let’s try to observe some dictionary-ordered strings like “raj”, “rax”, and “rbx”. If we carefully observe, we can notice that these strings contain a common prefix, and the rankings are done based on the differentiating characters.

For example, “raj” and “rax” has a common prefix i.e. “ra” and the differentiating characters are ‘j’ and ‘x’. Now, as ‘j’ appears before ‘x’ in the alphabet, “raj” appears before “rax” in the given order. The same logic is applicable for “rax” and “rbx”(_Common prefix: “r”, differentiating characters: ‘a’ and ‘b’)_.

The same observation can be done on the permutations of numbers. For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3], all possible permutations in sorted order will look like the following:

- [1, 2, 3]
- [1, 3, 2]
- [2, 1, 3]
- [2, 3, 1]
- [3, 1, 2]
- [3, 2, 1]

In the above cases, we can also notice that all the permutations contain an index i(_between the first and second last index_) such that its right part is sorted in decreasing order. Now, **if we look at the array in the backward direction, it is sorted in increasing order up to index i (_from n-1 to index i+1_****).**

**_We can call this index i as the break-point of the array._** The left half of index i (_the length of the left half might be 0_) in the current permutation is the same as in the previous permutation. And the right half of the break-point is always in decreasing order.

The structure of every possible permutation is the following:

![](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-30-232902.png)

**After all, we can conclude that the difference between the next and current permutation always starts at the index i i.e. the break-point. How to find the break-point in an array:  
**We can clearly observe that the right half of the break-point will always be in decreasing order. So, **_from the backside, the array will be in increasing order up to the break-point index_**. Keeping this in mind, we will traverse the array from the backside and we will break from the first index where arr[i] becomes smaller than arr[i+1]. The code will look like the following:

![](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-30-233007.png)

**Observation 2**
**If the break-point does not exist i.e. ind remains -1 in the code:**For an array that is sorted in decreasing order break-point does not exist. Here, we can assure that the given array is the last one in the sorted order of all permutations. In this case, the break-point index will be -1, the right half of the break-point will be the whole array and the left half will be of length 0.

In this case, the next permutation should be as minimum as possible. So to achieve it, we just need to reverse the whole array. And this will be our answer in this case. The code will look like the following:

![](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-30-233130.png)

**Observation 3**

Until now, we have found the break-point where the difference starts in the permutations. **_As the left half of the break-point should remain the same, we will not perform any operation on the left half._** 

Now we need to modify the break-point and the right half to get the next permutation. By the convention of ordering, we can say that the element at the break-point in the next permutation should be the next greater element of arr[break-point] in the current permutation.

Now to find the next greater element, we cannot use the whole array as the left half of the break-point should remain the same. But we can use the right half as it can be modified.

So, we will find the next greater element of arr[break-point] from the right half and swap it with arr[break-point] itself. Next greater element of arr[break-point] means the smallest element in the right half, greater than arr[break-point].

**How to find and swap the next greater element of arr[break-point]:  
**The right half is sorted in decreasing order(or increasing order from the backside). So, we will again **_traverse the array in the backward direction, and at the first index where arr[index] > arr[break-point], we will swap arr[index] and arr[break-point]_**.

The code will be the following:

![](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-30-233316.png)

**_For example_**, if the given array is {2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 0, 0}, the break-point will be index 1, and the next greater element of arr[1] i.e. 1 is 3 from the right half. After swapping the array will be like: {2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 0, 0}.

**Observation 4**
From the above example, we can observe that after swapping the right half remains sorted in decreasing fashion as it was before. Until now, we have modified the break-point. Now we are only left to modify the right half accordingly.

We want the permutation to be as close as possible to the given one. After swapping, the new element at the break-point has already made it greater from the given permutation. Now we want the right part to be the minimum possible and then only the permutation will be the closest to the given one. Hence, we will simply reverse the entire right half to make it ascending.

The code will be the following:

![](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-30-233436.png)

Finally, the above array will be like {2, 3, 0, 0, 1, 4, 5}.

                {
                    swap(nums[i],nums[index]);
                    break;
                }
            }
            reverse(nums.begin()+index+1,nums.end());
        }
    }
};
```
