**[Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)**  {Sort an array of 0's, 1's and 2's}

Medium

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
```
**Constraints:**

-   `n == nums.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 300`
-   `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

**Follow up:** Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

##### Hint
1. A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
2. Iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's.
3. Overwrite array with the total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.

	**red:** 0  
	**white:** 1  
	**blue:** 2


#### Approach 1: Using Sorting Function

#### Complexity

-   Time complexity: O(nlogn)
    
-   Space complexity: O(1)
    

#### Code

```cpp


// Using Sorting Function
// Time complexity --> O(nlogn) and Space --> O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {

        sort(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        
    }
};
```

**Note:**  
Logically using the above code is not good because according to the question, It is clearly written to solve a problem without using the library's sort function.

#### Approach 2: Using Counting Approach

#### Complexity

-   Time complexity: O(n)+O(n) ~ O(2n)
    
-   Space complexity: O(1)
    

#### Code

```cpp

// Using Counting Approach
// Time complexity --> O(n) + O(n) ~ O(2n) and Space --> O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i,countzero=0, countone=0,counttwo=0; 
        int n=nums.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            // switch(nums[i])
            // {
            //     case 0: 
            //         countzero++;
            //         break;
            //     case 1: 
            //         countone++;
            //         break;
            //     case 2: 
            //         counttwo++;
            //         break;
            // }

            // -------OR ------- 

            if(nums[i]==0)
            {
                countzero++;
               
            }
            else if(nums[i]==1)
            {
                countone++;
                
            }
            else if(nums[i]==2)
            {
                counttwo++;
        
            }
        }
        i=0;
        while(countzero>0)
        {
            nums[i]=0;
            countzero--;
            i++;
        }
        while(countone>0)
        {
            nums[i]=1;
            countone--;
            i++;
        }
        while(counttwo>0)
        {
            nums[i]=2;
            counttwo--;
            i++;
        }
        
    }
};
```

#### Approach 3: Using Pointer Approach [ Dutch National Flag Algorithm ]

#### Complexity

-   Time complexity: O(n)
    
-   Space complexity: O(1)
    

**Algorithm / Intuition**

_This problem is a variation of the popular_ **_Dutch National flag algorithm_**_._ 

This algorithm contains 3 pointers i.e. low, mid, and high, and 3 main rules.  The rules are the following:

```
arr[0….low-1] contains 0. [Extreme left part]
arr[low….mid-1] contains 1.
arr[high+1….n-1] contains 2. [Extreme right part], n = size of the array
```


The middle part i.e. arr[mid….high] is the unsorted segment. So, hypothetically the array with different markers will look like the following:

![](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-18-171206.png)

In our case, we can assume that the entire given array is unsorted and so we will place the pointers accordingly. For example, if the given array is: [2,0,2,1,1,0], the array with the 3 pointers will look like the following:

![](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-18-171326.png)

Here, as the entire array is unsorted, we have placed the mid pointer in the first index and the high pointer in the last index. The low is also pointing to the first index as we have no other index before 0. Here, we are mostly interested in placing the ‘mid’ pointer and the ‘high’ pointer as they represent the unsorted part in the hypothetical array.

Now, let’s understand how the pointers will work to make the array sorted.

**Approach:**

**Note:** _Here in this tutorial we will work based on the value of the mid pointer._

The steps will be the following:

1. First, we will run a loop that will continue until **mid <= high**.
2. There can be three different values of mid pointer i.e. arr[mid]
    1. **If arr[mid] == 0,** we will swap arr[low] and arr[mid] and will increment both low and mid. Now the subarray from index 0 to (low-1) only contains 0.
    2. **If arr[mid] == 1,** we will just increment the mid pointer and then the index (mid-1) will point to 1 as it should according to the rules.
    3. **If arr[mid] == 2,** we will swap arr[mid] and arr[high] and will decrement high. Now the subarray from index high+1 to (n-1) only contains 2.  
        In this step, we will do nothing to the mid-pointer as even after swapping, the subarray from mid to high(_after decrementing high_) might be unsorted. So, we will check the value of mid again in the next iteration.
3. Finally, our array should be sorted.

**Dry Run:**

Assume the given array is [2,0,2,1,1,0]. The algorithm will be the following:

![](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-18-171428.png)

![](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-18-173242.png)

![](https://takeuforward.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Screenshot-2023-03-18-173322.png)

In each iteration, if we check, the rules are always valid. This is how the algorithm works.

#### Code

```cpp
// Using Pointer Approach (Dutch National Flag Algorithm)
// Time complexity --> O(n) and Space -->O(1)
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int n=nums.size();
        int l=0;
        int h=n-1;
        int mid=0;

        while(mid<=h)
        {
            if(nums[mid]==0)
            {
                swap(nums[l],nums[mid]);
                l++;
                mid++;
            }
            else if(nums[mid]==1)
            {
                mid++;

            }
            else if(nums[mid]==2)
            {
                swap(nums[mid],nums[h]);
                h--;
            }
        }
        
    }
};
```
